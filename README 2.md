# Encryption and Decryption Script

This script implements a custom encryption and decryption algorithm using Python.
The script defines five functions: generate_keys, encrypt, decrypt, string_to_int_list, and int_list_to_string.

## How it works

The generate_keys function takes in three arguments: K, H, and P. 
K is the key used to generate the subkeys, H is a user-defined permutation, 
and P is a fixed permutation defined in the function. 
The function applies the permutation H to the key K and generates two subkeys k1 and k2 using bitwise operations.

The encrypt function takes in four arguments: N, k1, k2, and pi. 
N is the message to be encrypted, represented as a list of integers, k1 and k2 are the subkeys generated by the generate_keys function, and pi is a user-defined shift order. 

The function applies the shift order pi to the message N, splits it into two halves, and performs several rounds of bitwise operations using the subkeys and a fixed permutation to generate the encrypted message.

The decrypt function takes in four arguments: C, k1, k2, and pi.
C is the encrypted message, represented as a list of integers, k1 and k2 are the subkeys generated by the generate_keys function, and pi is the same shift order used in the encryption process. 

The function applies the shift order to the encrypted message, splits it into two halves, and performs several rounds of bitwise operations using the subkeys and the inverse of the fixed permutation used in the encryption process to recover the original message.

The script also defines two additional functions: string_to_int_list and int_list_to_string.
The first function takes in a string as an argument and returns a list of integers representing the ASCII codes of each character in the string. 

The second function takes in a list of integers as an argument and returns a string obtained by converting each integer to its corresponding ASCII character.

## How to execute

To execute this script, you need to have Python installed on your computer. 
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved this script, and run it using the command:

python encryptionTp.py

The script will prompt you to enter values for several variables:

K: The key used to generate the subkeys. Enter a string of 8 characters.

H: The user-defined permutation used in key generation. Enter 8 integers separated by spaces.

pi: The user-defined shift order used in encryption/decryption. Enter 8 integers separated by spaces.

N: The message to be encrypted. Enter a string.

After entering these values, press Enter to run the script.

The script will convert these values to lists of integers using the string_to_int_list function, generate two subkeys using the provided key and permutation, encrypt the message using these subkeys and shift order, and decrypt it again using these same subkeys and shift order. 

The script will then convert these values back to text using the int_list_to_string function and print out both subkeys and encrypted message then decrypted message.


## Here is an example of how this script can be used:

``` python encryptionTp.py
Please enter the values of K: (K is the key used to generate the subkeys) separated by spaces: abcdefgh
Please enter the values of H: (H is the user-defined permutation used) separated by spaces: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
Please enter the values of pi: (pi is the user-defined shift order used) separated by spaces: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Please enter the values of N: (N is the message to be encrypted): Hello!
Subkeys: gfed hhhh
Encrypted message: hhhhhhhh
Decrypted message: Hello!
In this example, the user entered abcdefgh as the key K, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
and 0 as the permutation H, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
and 7 as the shift order pi, 
and Hello! as the message to be encrypted.
The script converted these values to lists of integers using the string_to_int_list function, generated two subkeys using these values and the generate_keys function, encrypted the message using the encrypt function, and decrypted it again using the decrypt function. 
The script then converted these values back to text using the int_list_to_string function and printed out both subkeys and encrypted message then decrypted message.
